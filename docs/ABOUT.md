#About Discrete Math programs

This project is a collection of programs designed to assist and verify graphs within discrete mathematics.  Each program serves a specific purpose to help understand and solve various problems in the field.

##Programs

### `treeseq.cpp`

This program checks if a given degree sequence can represent a tree. A tree must have no isolated vertices and the sum of degrees must be twice the number of vertices minus two.

### `subgraphofgraph.cpp`

This program detects subgraphs within a graph, such as complete graphs, paths, and specific subgraphs like K_1,4 and C_4.

### `stargraph.cpp`

Calculates the number of edges in a star graph given the number of vertices.

### `sequencesimplegraph.cpp`

Checks if a simple graph exists for a given degree sequence using Havel-Hakimi algorithm.

### `cyclegraph.cpp`

Calculates the number of edges in a cycle graph based on the number of vertices.

### `constructgraphvertices.cpp`

Constructs a graph based on specified vertices and their degrees, ensuring that the resulting graph meets the given degree constraints.

### `completegraph.cpp`

Calculates the number of edges in a complete graph with `n` vertices.

### `completebipartitegraph.cpp`

Calculates the number of edges in a complete bipartite graph with `m` and `n` vertices in each set.

### `coefficient.cpp`

Calculates the coefficients in polynomial expansions of the form `(x + a)^n`.

### `chkbipartite.cpp`

Checks if a given graph is bipartite using BFS.

## Motivation

These programs are intended to provide tools for students and researchers working in discrete mathematics and graph theory. They offer practical examples and can be used as a learning resource.
