#Discrete Math Programs
This repo contains a collection of C++ programs to assist w/ various topics in discrete math.  Each program addresses a specific problem or concept w/in the field.

##Progams
-'treeseq.cpp': Checks if a sequence is a tree.
-'subgraphofgraph.cpp': Detects subgraphs within a graph.
-'stargraph.cpp': Calculates the # of edges in a star graph.
-'sequencesimplegraph.cpp': Checks if a simple graph exists for a given degree sequence.
-'cyclegraph.cpp': Calculates the # of edges in a cycle graph.
-'constructgraphvertices.cpp': Constructs a graph based on specified vertices and degrees.
-'completegraph.cpp': Calculates the # of edges in a complete graph.
-'completebipartitegraph.cpp': Calculates the # of edges in a complete bipartite graph.
-'coefficient.cpp': Calculates coefficients in polynomial expansions.
-'chkbipartite.cpp': Checks if a graph is bipartite.

##Compilation

To compile the programs, use a C++ compiler such as 'g++'.  

e.g.:
In terminal, or shell:
g++ -o treeseq src/treeseq.cpp

##Usage

Each program runs in the terminal and prompts the user for input.  For example, to check if a sequence is a tree, you may use:

./treeseq

Follow the prompts to enter the # of vertices and their degrees.
